__About This Project__

This is the collection website for Elena Davidiak's grant funded research into Spanish Speakers in the US Medical Services, created in cooperation with the SBU Center For Digital Humanities ([SBU CDH website](https://library.stonybrook.edu/digital-humanities/))

__This website was created using Wax__

__Wax is an extensible workflow for producing scholarly exhibitions with minimal computing principles.__<br>
It's comprised of: __a few Ruby gems__ for processing image data and associated metadata ([wax_tasks](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_tasks/), [wax_iiif](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_iiif/)), __a Jekyll theme__ ([wax_theme](https://github.com/minicomp/wax/)), and (hopefully soon!) a lot of __documentation and recipes__ for creating, deploying, and maintaining digital exhibitions.
