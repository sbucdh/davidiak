I"§<h3>Â¿Me entiende? Understanding the Hispanic patient</h3>

<p>A digital collection by <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/hispanic/people/davidiak.php">Elena Davidiak, PhD</a></p>

<p>This project was largely inspired by personal communication with foreign-born US residents about their experiences seeking medical care. It seeks to explore the effect of the language barrier, and the effect of cultural factors in the absence of such barrier.</p>

<p>This collection of 15 semi-structured interviews with 1st generation Spanish speakers is aimed at helping future medical providers to notice ways in which they may fail to communicate appropriately with  Hispanic patients, and ways in which patients may react to their words and actions differently than expected. This way, it may help them to prevent conscious and unconscious bias in their attitude and behavior towards immigrant Hispanic patients.</p>

<p>This project is funded by the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (FAHSS) grant at Stony Brook University.
